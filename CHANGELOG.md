## 1.5.3 — 2026-07-28

### Fixed — the rest of the control panel still swallowed every rejection

1.5.2 fixed the campaign form because that is where the reused-handle guard runs. The gap was never limited to that one form: no other page in this control panel rendered what the server sent back either. Creating a list, renaming a list, creating a template, adding a subscriber, sending a test mail, scheduling a send — every one of them answered a rejected input the same way. Nothing was written, nothing was said, and the button looked broken. That is worse than the bug a guard prevents, because a person who cannot see why their input was refused will try the same thing again.

Errors now appear **at the field they belong to**, using the `error` prop Statamic's `Field` component already has — the same thing LeadHub 1.5.0 does for its contact form, so the two addons behave alike. A summary above the form was the cheaper option and would have been the wrong one: the sender fields sit in a sidebar, and a red line at the top of the page does not tell you which of eleven inputs is the problem.

Not every rejection maps to an input. A test send refused because the campaign has no list arrives under a key no field carries. Those go into a collected block above the form, so nothing the server says can fall through the floor. Both paths, not one: a page that only had the summary would have hidden the field errors' location, and a page that only had field errors would have dropped everything else.

The three listing pages send nothing but delete requests, and the server currently has no rejection for a delete. They were wired up anyway, so that a delete guard added later is not silently swallowed a second time.

**Guarded structurally, not by a browser test.** There is no JS test runner in this addon and this release does not introduce one. Instead `CpValidationVisibilityTest` reads the page components: every function that submits must handle the rejection, every submitting page must have somewhere to put an unassignable error, and every field the controllers validate must be rendered somewhere. A form added without error handling fails the suite.

## 1.5.2 — 2026-07-27

### Fixed — validation errors were invisible in the campaign form

Found while photographing the 1.5.0 fix: the rejected handle worked exactly as intended, and the screen showed nothing at all. The request came back with errors, nothing was saved, and Save simply looked dead. A guard nobody can see is barely better than the silent wrong send it replaced, so the form now renders what came back.

The same gap exists elsewhere in this control panel — no page in it rendered validation errors — but only the campaign form is fixed here, because that is the one this release's guard runs in.

## 1.5.1 — 2026-07-27

### Fixed — the e-mail field fix in 1.5.0 did not work

1.5.0 replaced `flex-1` with `flex-1 min-w-56`, which was the right diagnosis and the wrong remedy: Statamic's `Field` brings its own `min-w-0`, and between two utilities of equal specificity the stylesheet order decides — so the column still computed to zero width and the neighbouring field still sat on top of it. Measured in a running control panel rather than reasoned about: 26 px before, 313 px after. The field now carries an explicit width, which is what its two neighbours already did.

## 1.5.0 — 2026-07-27

### Fixed — the public routes worked for nobody under multi-brand

Confirmation links, unsubscribe links and open/click tracking are opened without a session, so no brand was current and the fail-closed scope hid the very record the token pointed at. A subscription could never be confirmed and stayed pending forever; every unsubscribe link in every sent mail led to a 404; and tracking was the quiet one — the pixel returned 200 and the redirect returned 302 while nothing at all was stored, so campaign statistics sat at 0 % and nothing looked broken.

The brand now comes from the token, which belongs to exactly one record (`SetBrandFromRouteValue`, brand-context 1.4.0). Each column used for this carries a unique index across all brands; that is the precondition, and the lookup throws rather than guesses if it is ever violated. An unknown token still does exactly what it did before: nothing.

**Multi-brand requires the eloquent storage driver.** Flat-file lists live in YAML and carry no brand at all, so the public subscribe endpoint has nothing to derive one from.

### Fixed — one-click unsubscribe answered 419 to every mail provider

The CSRF exclusion on the RFC 8058 route named `ValidateCsrfToken`, but the class in the stack is `PreventRequestForgery` — Laravel renamed it, and excluding a name that is not there matches nothing silently. Gmail and Outlook call this endpoint themselves and read a 419 as a broken unsubscribe path, which is the kind of thing that costs deliverability. All known names are now listed.

### Fixed — reusing a campaign handle reported a send that never happened

Deleting a campaign leaves its delivery rows behind on purpose: they are the record of what went to whom. But a message is identified by campaign handle plus subscriber, so a new campaign on the same handle inherited them, skipped every recipient as already sent, finished instantly and reported success — with not one mail sent. Creating a campaign on a handle that already has delivery history is now refused, with an explanation. History is kept, and no send is ever claimed that did not happen.

### Fixed — an editor's addition was confirmed and asked to confirm at the same time

Adding a subscriber in the control panel deliberately bypasses double opt-in, but it did so *after* the subscription was written — by which time the confirmation mail was already on its way. The person was set to subscribed and asked to confirm the same thing. The decision now happens before writing (`skip_confirmation`); public sign-ups are untouched.

### Fixed — the e-mail field in "add subscriber" was unusable with a mouse

`flex-1` alone gave it a flex-basis of zero, so it collapsed to a sliver its neighbour overlapped.

## 1.1.0 — 2026-07-03

### Added — send to segment

- **Campaign audience narrowing via LeadHub segments.** A campaign can now target an optional **segment** in addition to its list. At send time the audience is `subscribed list members ∩ LeadHub::segmentMemberIds(handle)`, resolved live. The segment only ever *narrows*: consent is always taken from the list subscription, so a segment member who is not a subscribed list member (or who unsubscribed) never receives the campaign, and a subscriber with no linked LeadHub contact is excluded when a segment is set. No segment = the whole list, exactly as before (**backward compatible**).
- **Graceful degradation.** The facade call is guarded with `method_exists(LeadHub::getFacadeRoot(), 'segmentMemberIds')`. If the installed LeadHub predates segments, the filter is ignored (whole-list send) with a single logged warning, and the CP segment picker hides itself — no fatals.
- **CP segment selector.** The campaign form shows a segment dropdown (only when segments are available) with a live member count next to each option.
- **`segment_handle`** added to the campaign schema/data/repositories (eloquent + flat).

### Requirements

- Requires `goldnead/statamic-leadhub` **^1.1** (for the segments API). Merges after LeadHub v1.1.0 is tagged.

### Notes

- Suite green on both drivers: flat **74 passed + 7 skipped**, eloquent **73 passed + 8 skipped** (baseline 66 + 7). New coverage: intersection, consent precedence (segment member not subscribed / unsubscribed segment member never receives), no-linked-contact exclusion, backward compatibility, and graceful degradation when LeadHub lacks segments.

## 1.0.1 — 2026-07-02

### Fixed

- **Eloquent-users compatibility.** The CP base controller called Statamic-only methods (`hasPermission()`, `isSuper()`) on the raw authenticated user. On sites using the eloquent users repository the auth user is a plain model (e.g. `App\Models\User`), so every Marketing CP page crashed with a `BadMethodCallException`. Permission checks now go through Laravel's Gate (`$user->can()`, which Statamic wires up via `Gate::after` for both user drivers). Regression-tested with `statamic.users.repository=eloquent` and a plain `Authenticatable` model.

## 1.0.0 — 2026-07-02

Initial release.

- Boot-order regression tests for the sibling-addon bridges: deferred
  app->booted() registration with trailing retry, no-mark-booted while the
  sibling binding is absent, and idempotent re-boot (mirrors the LeadHub
  fix from statamic-leadhub@9fd6d6a).

- Mailing lists with per-list double opt-in and public subscribe endpoint
  (honeypot-guarded) plus `{{ marketing:subscribe }}` Antlers tag.
- Campaigns with Antlers content, reusable email templates, preview, test
  send, scheduling (`marketing:send-scheduled`), and queued batch delivery
  with optional throttling.
- Open pixel + signed click tracking, per-campaign reports, per-recipient
  message log.
- Tokenized unsubscribe pages and RFC 8058 one-click unsubscribe headers,
  optional global opt-out.
- LeadHub integration (hard dependency): contact upsert + timeline events on
  subscribe/unsubscribe, `list:{handle}` contact tags, opt-out on hard
  bounces/complaints.
- ESP feedback processing (generic/Mailgun/Postmark) — exposed as the
  `marketing.process_esp_event` inbound action when statamic-webhook-manager
  is installed; marketing events double as outbound webhook triggers.
- statamic-automations integration: `marketing.subscribed` /
  `marketing.unsubscribed` / `marketing.campaign_sent` triggers and
  `marketing.subscribe` / `marketing.unsubscribe` / `marketing.send_campaign`
  actions.
- Dual storage for definitions: flat YAML under `content/marketing/`
  (default) or Eloquent (`MARKETING_DRIVER=eloquent`); runtime data always in
  `marketing_*` tables.
- Control Panel: Dashboard, Lists (incl. subscriber management), Campaigns
  (composer + report), Templates — Inertia + Vue 3 with Statamic UI
  components, English and German translations.
